## Projects
**End-to-End Semantic Search Tool for YouTube Videos from a Specific Channel**\
I built an end-to-end semantic search tool for YouTube videos from a specific channel (3Blue1Brown), designed to help users quickly find relevant content using natural language queries. The tool fetches video titles and transcripts via **API**, processes and embeds the data, and performs semantic search to return the most relevant results. I wrapped everything in a **FastAPI** app, containerized it with **Docker**, and deployed it on **AWS** using **Hugging Face Spaces**. It's live and ready to try — [check it out here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/masamadikh/YouTubeSemanticSearch)

**LLM-Powered Chatbot with RAG and LangChain**\
I designed and deployed an LLM-powered chatbot using LangChain and LangFlow, enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for smarter, more accurate responses. The system uses LlamaIndex to index and query documents efficiently, allowing the chatbot to provide context-aware answers by grounding its responses in relevant data. This project gave me hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools like OpenAI LLMs, RAG pipelines, and conversational AI systems — all aimed at improving response quality and scalability.

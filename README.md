## Projects
**End-to-End Semantic Search Tool for YouTube Videos from a Specific Channel** [check it out here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/masamadikh/YouTubeSemanticSearch)
  - **What it is:** A FastAPI service that lets you query 3Blue1Brown videos using natural‑language.  
  - **How it is built:**  
    - Fetched titles/transcripts via YouTube API  
    - Processed & embedded data with Sentence Transformers  
    - Semantic search layer to rank relevant clips  
  - **Deployment:** Containerized in Docker, deployed to AWS via Hugging Face Spaces  
  - **Why it matters:** Cuts video‑browsing time by surfacing exact moments matching your query.

**ML Web App for Cancer Prediction** [check it out here](https://predictcancer-amin.streamlit.app/)
  - **What it is:** An interactive Streamlit web app that predicts whether a breast mass is benign or malignant based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset and user‑provided measurements via sliders.
  - **How it is built:** 
    - Loaded and preprocessed the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset with pandas, and trained a classifier.
    - Created a sidebar containing sliders for cell‑nuclei measurements.  
    - Developed a radar chart using Plotly to visualize mean, standard‑error, and worst measurements—scaling inputs in real time.
    - Implemented a prediction display that shows class (benign/malignant) and probabilities.
  - **Deployment:** Hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud with continuous integration from GitHub for seamless updates.
  - **Why it matters:** Demonstrates a complete end‑to‑end ML application pipeline—enabling rapid prototyping of diagnostic tools that can assist medical professionals with an intuitive interface.

**LLM‑Powered Chatbot with RAG & LangChain** 
  - **What it is:** A conversational assistant that grounds answers in external documents.  
  - **How it is built:** 
    - LangChain + LangFlow for pipeline orchestration  
    - LlamaIndex for efficient document indexing and retrieval  
    - OpenAI LLM for generation, wrapped in a simple interface  
  - **Deployment:** Hosted on Vercel (or your preferred platform)  
  - **Why it matters:** Improves answer accuracy by pulling in real‑world context on demand.  

**Edmonton Real Estate Price Prediction**
EDA and predicting the price of real estate based on the given features such as location and size, using Python and R
programming languages

**Deep Learning for Robotic Motion Planning**

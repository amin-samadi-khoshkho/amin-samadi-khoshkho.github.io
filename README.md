## Projects
**End-to-End Semantic Search Tool for YouTube Videos from a Specific Channel**

I built an end-to-end semantic search tool for YouTube videos from a specific channel (3Blue1Brown), designed to help users quickly find relevant content using natural language queries. The tool fetches video titles and transcripts via API, processes and embeds the data, and performs semantic search to return the most relevant results. I wrapped everything in a FastAPI app, containerized it with Docker, and deployed it on AWS using Hugging Face Spaces. It's live and ready to try â€” [check it out here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/masamadikh/YouTubeSemanticSearch)
